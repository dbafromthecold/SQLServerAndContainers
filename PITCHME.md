### Session Aim

To give an overview of the different options available to run SQL Server in containers

---

### Container Definition

Containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment. <br>

### Virtual Machines vs Containers

## Case Study

---

### Problem

QA/Dev departments repeatedly creating new VMs <br>
All VMs require a local instance of SQL Server <br>
SQL installed from chocolately <br>
30+ databases then restored via PoSH scripts <br>
SQL install taking ~40 minutes from start to finish

---

### Solution

Containers! <br>
Implement containers running SQL Server <br>
SQL containers built from custom image <br>
No longer need to install SQL <br>
No longer need to restore databases <br>
Resources freed up on VMs 

---

### Windocks

A port of the open source project from Docker Inc. <br>
Software supports the creation of containers running earlier versions of SQL Server (2008+) on Windows Server 2008+ <br>
Free Community Edition available

### Benefits

New VMs deployed in a fraction of the previous time <br>
No longer need to run PoSH scripts to restore databases <br>
Base image can be used to keep containers at production level <br>
More VMs can be provisioned on host due to each VM requiring less resources 

---

### Issues

Apps using DNS entries to reference local SQL instance <br>
Update to existing test applications <br>
Trial and error to integrate with Octopus deploy <br>
New ways of thinking

### Session Aim

To give an overview of the different options available to run SQL Server in containers

---

### Container Definition

Containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment. <br>
